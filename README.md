# TwitterCorrect
TwitterCorrect is a web-based application that corrects users' tweets on Twitter. Cleaning consists of filtering tweets for words that are politically incorrect
or not appropriate. Users are then afforded the option of removing these tweets in mass.
# Flow
Users are required to sign-in onto their Twitter account using the Twitter API O-Auth process to grant access to the application. Users can use two modes, a free 
version of the service which scans up to 200 tweets. The second version is paid and allows users to scan unlimited tweets.
